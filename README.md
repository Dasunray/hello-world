By default my repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive(අවසාන,නියත,ස්ථිර) branch. 
People can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main definitive(අවසාන,නියත,ස්ථිර) branch

When we create a branch off the main branch, we are making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the main branch while we were working on our branch, we could pull in those updates.

we use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. 
When a change is ready, they merge their branch into main
