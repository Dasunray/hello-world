By default my repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive(අවසාන,නියත,ස්ථිර) branch. 
People can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main definitive(අවසාන,නියත,ස්ථිර) branch

we use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. 
When a change is ready, they merge their branch into main
